        <h2>My Story in Shanghai</h2>

        <p class="first"><Strong>Shanghai</strong> is the most modern city in China, and it was built to look like New
          York City. Shanghai is the most desired city by most young Chinese, not only for its economy but also for its
          modern architecture. Although I think living in Shanghai can be a bit exhausting, I have to admit it's a very
          nice city to visit!</p>
