        <h2>My Story in Sanya</h2>

        <p class="first"><Strong>Sanya</strong> is the southernmost city in China, it faces the sea and is the largest tourist city in China. It has some of the best beaches and coastline in China, much like Miami, and before I came to study at the University of Miami, my parents would bring me to Hainan for vacation every summer period. (When I came to college, I never went back. After all, I lived every day in the "Hainan" part of the United States.) But Hainan is still a great place to go, there is a lot of seafood, and it's a great place to vacation!</p>
