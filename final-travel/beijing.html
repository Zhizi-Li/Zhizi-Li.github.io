        <h2>My Story in Beijing</h2>

        <p class="first"><Strong>Beijing</strong> is the cultural capital of China, similar to Washington, D.C. in the
          United States. With a history of over 3,000 years, Beijing is one of the few ancient cities in China.</p>

        <p>Because Beijing is the center of education in China, I went to high school in Beijing. After living in Beijing
          for 4 years, I can say that Beijing is the second city I am familiar with in China.</p>

            <h3>The Old Downtwon Area</h3>

            <p>The old downtown area of Beijing has many hutongs (blocks). Surrounded by one- and two-story old buildings,
              they preserve the look of Beijing as it was 200 years ago. In the hutongs, there are many traditional snacks
              and cultural stores, as well as many art galleries and exhibition halls. In high school, I used to come to
              the
              hutongs with my friends to shop and buy milk tea from the famous stores.</p>

            <h3>The Forbidden City</h3>

            <p>The Forbidden City was the imperial palace of the Qing Dynasty, and it is in the center of the entire city
              of
              Beijing, with a history of 598 years. You can enjoy and appreciate the history of China and the glory and
              wealth of the past life of the emperor on your way to see it. The Forbidden City has another beauty when it
              snows, because on average Beijing gets 2-3 snowfalls a year, so I picked a photo of me taking a picture of
              the
              Forbidden City after it snows.</p>

          <h3>Peking Duck</h3>

          <p>Peking duck is a world-renowned Beijing dish made from high-quality meat duck, roasted over a charcoal fire
            with fruit wood, with red color and fatty but not greasy meat. It is famous in China and abroad for its color,
            tender meat, mellow taste characteristics. This is also my favorite food in Beijing!</p>
